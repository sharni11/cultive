      <ol>
        <li>Identify the Space on Your Terrace:</li>
        <p>You need to define the position you have before you begin your terrace garden. Such as your windowsills, balconies, your rooftop, you can access the area. You should make a plan for your terrace garden, depending on the location you have. It includes the plant form to grow in these windowsills, balconies, rooftops. The main thing to keep in mind is that the place you choose should have direct sunlight for at least 4-5 hours. This dimension is so much necessary.</p>
        <li>Make a Plan to Divide the Available Space:</li>
        <p>You must draw up a plan to divide the available space once you have defined the location you have. A variety of vegetable plants, including shade plants and normal plants, can be grown. You have to divide the space according to the sunlight and the space that the vegetable plant that you grow requires. In addition, space should be reserved for nursery, composting, waste management, storage, etc.</p>
        <li>Watering/Irrigation:</li>
        <p>One of the things most people do is not water the plants that often have vegetables. When you grow on your rooftop vegetable plants, water evaporates rapidly. The plants, therefore, need water on a daily basis, especially during the summer. You will water once in two days in the Monsoon and Winter seasons. During the rainy season, you can plan for water harvesting.</p>
        <li>Waste Management:</li>
        <p>If you have a garden, you’re going to have a lot of waste as well. That could be dry leaves in the vegetable garden, or twigs, or any other stuff. You should, therefore, have proper management of waste. You can use some of the waste as a mulch in the summer season to prevent the water loss from the soil. You should remove the waste from your Terrace Garden, other than that.</p>
        <li>Composting:</li>
        <p>Having an Organic Terrace Garden is one of the best benefits of being able to turn your home into a zero-waste zone. All the waste you generate can be turned into compost in your home as well as in the Terrace Garden. All you need to have is a composter tub. You have to add all the waste to this bucket and add soil in a span of 30 odd days to make perfect compost. You can use this compost in your Organic Kitchen Garden as the Organic Fertilizer.</p>
