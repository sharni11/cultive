      <h3 class="a">10 Perennial Vegetables to Plant This Spring</h3>
      <p>Those new to gardening often grow annuals, unaware of the huge range of perennial vegetables they could consider. While I do plant a range of common annuals/biennials in my garden, I also have plenty of perennials, which deliver their yield not just for one season but over a number of years.


There are many benefits to growing perennial vegetables — both to the environment and for individual gardeners. So this spring, as you purchase seeds or plants, consider perennial vegetables as well as the more common annual/biennial crops.


There are hundreds of options you could opt for. But, to get you started, here are 20 possible choices for your garden:</p>
<img src="/images/document5.jpeg" alt="image">
<h5>Alliums</h5>
<p>From wild garlic, ramsons or ramps, to bunching or walking onions, chives, and perennial leeks, there is a wide range of plants in the onion family that will provide a yield over a number of years. They're not just good for culinary purposes. Perennial alliums are fantastic for pest control in perennial beds, fruit tree guilds, forest gardens, etc.</p>
<h5>Artichokes</h5>
<p>Both Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) and globe artichokes are excellent options, often growing very well in a range of conditions. The related cardoons and Maximilian sunflowers are other options in this group to consider. </p>
<h5>Asparagus</h5>
<p>Asparagus is definitely one of the best-known and most widely grown perennial vegetables. It can grow in beds alongside other perennial plants, or even in annual vegetable beds. Spring is a good time to think about planting asparagus crowns. They will not provide a yield right away but will provide dividends in the years to come. </p>
<h5>Brassicas</h5>
<p>There is a large number of perennials in the brassica (cabbage) family of cruciferous vegetables. Many brassicas commonly grown as annual crops will actually behave as short-lived perennials in warmer climate zones. And some are perennial even in cooler temperate climates. Amongst my favorites are "tree cabbage," perennial kale, and the everlasting cabbage (Ewiger kohl).</p>
<h5>Sea Kale</h5>
<p>Also related to the aforementioned brassicas, sea kale (Crambe maritima) is another excellent perennial vegetable to consider. The leaves are used like regular kale and other brassica greens, and the young shoots can also be treated like asparagus. Seeds should be nicked before sowing to encourage germination — but the effort is well worthwhile to establish a clump. </p>
<h5>Daylilies</h5>
<p>Daylilies are a great value vegetable. These plants offer a number of edible yields. Every part of the plant — from the tubers to the shoots to the blooms — is edible and each part has a range of different uses. The flowers, in particular, are considered to be a delicacy. </p>
<h5>Good King Henry</h5>
<p>Good King Henry is sometimes known as "poor man's asparagus" and was once commonly eaten as a vegetable in parts of Europe. It is related to the common edible weed lambsquarter (Chenopodium album), as well as to quinoa. The young shoots are used like asparagus, and leaves and flower buds are also edible. This is one of the plants I have found most useful in my forest garden. </p>
<h5>Groundnut</h5>
<p>The groundnut (Apios americana) is a nitrogen-fixing climber or vine, with edible (though tiny) tubers. It has a nutty, potato-like taste, and forms like strings of pearls below the ground. As an edible crop and nitrogen fixer, this is a great choice for many perennial gardens. </p>
<h5>Hablitzia</h5>
<p>This is another one of the many leafy-green, spinach-like vegetables that you can consider growing. This herbaceous perennial is a vine, producing an abundance of green leaves. Also known as Caucasian spinach, it can often thrive when grown up in a tree. </p>
<h5>Horseradish</h5>
<p>Horseradishes' fiery roots are an interesting addition to a homegrown diet. And this vegetable can also be a great companion plant. They are said to help in repelling a range of pest species and attract pollinators and other beneficial insects when in flower.
