      <h3 class="a">Summer Gardening Tips</h3>
      <p>Think summers and ice-cream and mangoes come to mind almost the same time as sweat and a perennial yearning for an AC. While we find our respite in summer-fresh foods and cooling hacks, our beloved gardens often end up taking the brunt of the harsh sunlight and rising temperatures. Excessive heat can be a source of stress for plants, particularly the home garden varieties, and cause plants to dry up or wither. Here are some simple ways in which you can ensure that the sunny days don’t leave your favourite plants high and dry.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Seasonal plants endure the weather better:</li>
        <p>Plants are essentially seasonal beings. Some plants are best grown in winter, while others thrive in the sunny days. With proper hydration and manure, chillies, cucumbers, brinjals and watermelon are ideal plants for the season and can even be grown in pots.</p>
        <li>A ‘shade’ in time saves nine</li>
        <p>Invest in a shade cloth for your plants, easily available in online stores and horticultural dealerships. The fabric thickness may vary; choose the fabric according to the plants of your garden. Install it over the trees and/or partially on the sides.</p>
        <li>Water plants at the right hour</li>
        <p>The best time to water your plants during summer is early morning or evening. The water is cooler during these hours. The best time to put on your gardening cap? Before 10am or post 4pm.</p>
        <li>Shower your plants in small doses</li>
        <p>Eschew the water hose for sprinklers or mugs. Summers are accompanied by dry spells — with growing water scarcity, it’s important to use the most economical means of watering plants.</p>
        <li>Plants can be friends too</li>
        <p>Bigger, sturdier plants can often help to provide shade for smaller and more delicate greens. Consider it a buddy system for your garden, and plan the arrangement of trees with this strategy in mind</p>
        <li>Keep tab on soil moisture</li>
        <p>There is such a thing as too much water for your plants. Before you turn on the sprinkler, check to see if the soil is moist under the surface. Wait till the soil is somewhat drier, or simply sprinkle water on the leaves and branches.</p>
        <li>Still waters run deep</li>
        <p>Prevent water from stagnating, whether on the soil or pots and trays. Standing water can pave the way for a mosquito infestation in addition to giving your beloved plants an H2O overdose.</p>
        <li>Compost goes a long way</li>
        <p>Along with watering the plants, composting helps to keep your plants — especially fruit-bearing and flowering ones — hydrated and healthy. You can easily make compost at home or purchase organic compost from community groups like Bengaluru’s Kora3B Compost.</p>
        <li>Mulch for healthy plants</li>
        <p>The other summer must-have is mulch, used to describe material spread on soil surface to keep it cool, prevent weeds and aid hydration. Mulch includes tree bark, compost, newspaper, bits of grass, shredded leaves and sawdust. Turn the mulch around every few days and remember to replace it when the mulch decomposes.</p>
